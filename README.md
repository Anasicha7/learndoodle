# LearnDoodle - Doodle Jump Clone 🚀

This is my first **JavaScript** practice project. I built this game to understand the core logic of web development and how to manipulate elements on the screen in real-time.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack:
* **HTML5**: For the basic game structure.
* **CSS3**: For the visual styling and grid layout.
* **JavaScript (Vanilla)**: For game logic, character movement, and gravity systems.

## 📝 Key Learnings:
* Using `addEventListener` to capture keyboard inputs for character control.
* Implementing loops to dynamically generate game platforms.
* Understanding basic game physics like gravity, collision detection, and jumping mechanics.

## 📺 Credits:
This project was built following a tutorial by **Code with Ania Kubów**. 
* **Channel**: [Code with Ania Kubów](https://www.youtube.com/c/ania-kubow)
* This exercise helped me bridge the gap between static CSS and interactive logic.
